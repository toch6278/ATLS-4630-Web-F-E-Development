        <p> For this assignment, the students are to create a web page that uses <br>
            Javascript to interact with the DOM (document object model) in the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li> Manipulate <strong> at least one CSS property </strong> through the DOM.</li>
                <li> Manipulate at least one other DOM property that <strong> is not a CSS property. </strong> </li> 
                <li> Respond to <strong> at least two different types of events </strong> using event listeners.</li>
            </ul> 
            Both your Javascript and your CSS should be in external files (not embedded in the HTML).</p>
